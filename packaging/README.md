# sudo-secretspec downstream packaging

Downstream releases are built from upstream SecretSpec `0.19.1` and stamp the
whole workspace — including the `secretspec` crate — with a downstream version
of the form `0.19.1-sudo.N`. `release.py` verifies both halves: that the
upstream tag it descends from carries `version = "0.19.1"`, and that this tree's
root `Cargo.toml` carries the downstream version being cut.

- Tag: `v0.19.1-sudo.N`
- Release title: `SecretSpec 0.19.1 — sudo-secretspec downstream N`
- Fork: `frdminc/sudo-secretspec` (parent `cachix/secretspec`)

The upstream base is a constant in `release.py`. Which downstream serial to cut
is a `--version` argument; rebasing onto a newer upstream tag is a separate,
larger decision and the script refuses to do it implicitly.

## Release

The maintainer entrypoint is `packaging/release.py`. It validates a clean
`sudo-main` tree, HTTPS remotes, the upstream `v0.19.1` ancestry/version, the
GitHub fork parent, that the workspace is stamped at the version being cut, and
that the tag is not already published — all before any write.

Bump `version` in the root `Cargo.toml` (and the two inter-crate `version =`
constraints beside it) first; preflight refuses to release a workspace stamped
at anything else.

```bash
# Safe preview; performs no writes.
python3 packaging/release.py --version 0.19.1-sudo.10 --dry-run

# Live release after packaging and companion changes are committed on sudo-main.
python3 packaging/release.py --version 0.19.1-sudo.10

# Alternate local tap clone.
python3 packaging/release.py --version 0.19.1-sudo.10 \
  --tap-path ~/src/homebrew-sudo-secretspec
```

The live flow runs focused Python and Rust tests, creates and pushes an
annotated tag, creates the titled GitHub Release with `gh`, downloads the tag
tarball over HTTPS, rewrites the formula SHA-256, commits/pushes that formula,
syncs the configured tap clone, force-refreshes Homebrew and the tap checkout,
reinstalls and tests the formula, then reads back repository parent, tag,
release title/state, and installed engine version. Interrupt cleanup removes
only a locally-created unpushed tag and an uncommitted formula rewrite; it
never deletes a pushed tag.

## Homebrew safety boundary

The formula runs `cargo install` twice — once for the upstream `secretspec`
engine, once for the `sudo-secretspec-cli` companion — and copies the AI
guidance and skill documents into `share/sudo-secretspec`.

Installation has no privileged side effects: it never invokes `sudo`, edits
sudoers, creates users, or mutates `/var/db`. The caveat tells the operator to
explicitly run `sudo-secretspec install` after reviewing the installed files.

Canonical formula: `packaging/homebrew/sudo-secretspec.rb`.
Tap clone default: `~/src/homebrew-sudo-secretspec`.
